# Driving_Simulator_URP_PS4Controller

# VERY VERY IMPORTANT just open the folder containing the assets and project settings folder, go to the scence named "0" if you got some error you can just ignore them and if
# everything is messed up just go install the Universal Render Pipeline from the package manager and fine you are good to go.
# The light might cause you some issues so make sure you start and turn it off couple times and it i'll get fixed.

# Introduction

  First let me say hello, this project is my first time diving into wheel colliders for learning purposes and ended up with some good results.
  Its a car driving simulation, this car is supposed to be a gold 6, basically its a car taken from Unity asser store very low poly and mis-shaped so i used my 3D skills (my first time too) and tried the best i have to change it and make it an interior and correct some problemsi noticed in the original file.
  
 # Simulation
 
  I've tried in this project to simulate car driving with some realistic data coming from internet about GOLF 6 cars (made by VolsWagen), got multiple cameras
  from different angle that you can switch between using the "C" button in your keyboard, you got a steering wheels synchronized with the actual passenger wheels for 
  steering. As i mentioned its my first time so the result wasn't accurate to be honest but it was cool anyways as you can see from the gif below.

  # Controle 
  
  This project uses a PS4 controller, i didn't really work on implementing other one and here's a quick over view.
  
  # Keyboard : 
  TAB: Start Engine
  C -> Changing camera
  L -> Light
  Space -> Hand brake.
  
  # PS4 Controller : 
  
  Right Joystick -> looking arround inside the car. (interior camera)
  Left Joystick -> Steering.
  Right Trigger -> Acceleration
  Left Trigger -> Brakes
  Left and Right pads -> for direction light.
  R1 -> Gear box UP
  R2 -> Gear box down
  
  inside the setting folder you can find 2 controllers presets, use the fixed one in case the default didn't work 
  Update: inside the "Driving_Simulator_URP_PS4Controller/Assets/Settings/Presets/Controle/" you can find the InputManager preset, apply this using a wired controller in order for the game to work correctly.
  THE GAME DOESN'T SUPPORT ANY OTHER TYPES OF CONTROLLERS YET
  
  # IMPORTANT : I USED A WIRED PS4 CONTROLLER

  # Light
  
  Head light / Brakes light / Backward Light / Right and Left Indicators.
  
  # Environement
  
  from the asset store and its not a well done environement but it was good for my testings, I tweaked a bit with the textures and upgraded to URP for a good looking results.
